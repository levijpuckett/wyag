# WYAG: Custom Git Implementation

A custom re-implementation of Git, the version control system, from the ground up. Learning exercise to understand how Git works.

Implements the fundamental building blocks of Git (objects) and uses them to create blobs, commits, trees, etc to create a rudimentary version control system.


Inspired by "Write Yourself a Git" by Thibault Polge: https://wyag.thb.lt/
